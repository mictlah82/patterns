# Template Method Pattern

## Intent
defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Why use it
- It's a method that defines an algorithm as a set of steps.
- One or more steps is defined to be abstract and implements by a subclass.
- Ensure the algorithm's structure stays unchanged.
